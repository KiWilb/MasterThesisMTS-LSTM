# MasterThesisMTS-LSTM

Python Notebooks used to train and evaluate the models for my master thesis "Assessing Global Applicability of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network for Rainfall-Runoff Modelling" at TU Delft in collaboration with Deltares. 

Notebooks starting with:
  - 00_: data checking and preparation
  - 01_: training MTS-LSTM models
  - 02_: Analysing results (CDF curves, maps, performance metrics and high flow sigantures) 

Used models: 
  - MTS-LSTM from neuralhydrology: https://github.com/neuralhydrology/neuralhydrology
  - wflow_sbm from Deltares: https://github.com/Deltares/Wflow.jl
